Restaurant Aggregate Rating Prediction

Project Overview:
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the aggregate ratings of restaurants based on various features such as location, cuisine type, cost, customer reviews, and other relevant factors. The goal is to help users and restaurant owners understand potential ratings before customers post feedback.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Regressor
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling
- Model Evaluation: Achieved 89% accuracy on test data 

Dataset:
- The dataset contains restaurant details including name, location, average cost, availability of online ordering, table booking, cuisines, and user ratings.
- Source: (Cognifyz technologies)

Features:
- Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline for missing and inconsistent data
- Feature engineering and selection to improve model performance
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics and visualization
- Prediction interface

Installation and Setup:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Encrypted10/Restaurant-rating-prediction.git
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
3. Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Place the dataset in the designated folder
5. Run data preprocessing and model training scripts or notebooks
6. Use provided scripts to generate predictions on new data

Usage:
- Train the model on the prepared dataset
- Use the prediction script to estimate aggregate ratings of restaurants based on input features
- Modify and tune model parameters to optimize performance as needed
